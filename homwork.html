<p>Smally's is located at the basement of skywalk started off as India's smallest cafe.The planning process of India's smallest cafe alone took two years. Operating massive menu into a square feet kitchen was the biggest challenge for Smallys.We were all of 138 square feet and therefore entered the Limca book of records as the smallest full fledged operating restaurant in India.

<p>We opened another 300 sqft cafe close by, with a seating capacity of 15 to 18, and is confident that we will break even within the next 7 - 8 months. We are also considering opening 3 more similar formats in Ulsoor, New BEL Road, and Indiranagar We made sure we were different.</p>

<p>Smallys stands apart from other cafes because here, food is prepared freshly, and there are no preservatives used. A sandwich or a burger is served fresh in less than 10 minutes. The meats and other raw ingredients are bought in every morning. We never carry forward meat to the next day, even though we have more dishes on the menu than most QSR chains.</p>
